Google's Identity Platform, which includes Google Sign-In and the underlying Identity Toolkit API, allows you to authenticate users with Google accounts.

Here's a general step-by-step guide on how to get a token from Google Identity Provider (IdP):

## Create a Google Cloud Project
Go to Google Cloud Console. If you haven't created a project, create one. You need this to enable the Identity Platform.

## Enable Google Identity Platform
In the Google Cloud Console, search for "Identity Platform" in the top search bar. Navigate to the Identity Platform section and enable it for your project.

## Create an OAuth Client ID
In the "Identity Platform" section, click on "Set up sign-in method" and then click on "Google". Here, you'll be guided to create an OAuth client ID. You'll also be asked to configure the OAuth consent screen. The OAuth client ID and secret are necessary for the following steps.

## Install Google Sign-In Libraries
Depending on your platform (Web, Android, iOS), you would need to install the respective libraries / SDKs that Google provides to enable Google Sign-In. For example, for a JavaScript web app, you would use the Google Sign-In JavaScript client.

## Implement Google Sign-In
Use the client libraries you've just installed to implement a sign-in button and sign-in flow. When a user signs in successfully, they will be returned a token (an ID token).

## Get the ID Token
After successful sign-in, you can get the ID token. In Python, for example, this would be done like so:
```
var id_token = googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token;
```

# Obtaining a Google ID Token
